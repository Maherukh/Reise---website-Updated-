      <h2>What's new in Reise?</h2>
      <p>Reise is more than just an App. How?</p>
    </header>

    <p>
      We at Reise went through a lot of applications which were related to
      travel. We say all apps are good but with some issues, so with a love of
      Travel we designed our own app meant to be not an app but a Companion.
      Yes, a virtual Companion which is for every traveler out there.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can classify the following apps to be of two types <br />
      <strong>1.Travel Application <br />
        2.Travel Companion</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      1.Travel Application is something people use for direction or like a
      to-do list which has places marked on it to check in and out. Ex: Maps,
      Google Travels, Tripit etc..
    </p>
    <p>
      2.Travel Companion is an app which gives a person which will show you
      around the place. Ex: Crouchsurfing, Meetup etc..
    </p>

    <p>
      We made an app which behaves like a Companion but is actually an app

          <h2>Discover the lesser known places</h2>
          <p>
            With our app you can discover places which are not very famous but
            interesting in their own sense, places which a guide or an app
            will not show as trending or mostly-visited. We have our own
            customized list of places which you can visit at your own pace and
            enjoy them just the way you like.
